/**
 * Contains classes that are backing beans for the Script Element, Production
 * Element, and Point of Interest pages.  While these classes don't directly
 * share any code, they all have similar methods.  They originally comprised
 * the pages within a single main header navigation menu item (called
 * Elements). Currently these pages are all included (along with others
 * in the "Script/Breakdown" main menu item.
 * <p>
 * As with a number of our backing beans for pages with left-hand item lists,
 * these classes all extend {@link com.lightspeedeps.web.view.ListImageView}.
