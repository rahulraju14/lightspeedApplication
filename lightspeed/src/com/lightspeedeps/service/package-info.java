/**
 * Contains classes that implement a variety of business-oriented
 * logic.  The intent is that these classes are independent of the
 * user interface.
 * <p>
 * This package was not introduced until V2.2 development.  For that
 * reason, most of the earlier "UI independent" code is not here, but
 * is in the com.lightspeedeps.util package instead.
