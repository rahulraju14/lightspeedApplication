/**
 * Contains classes related to the "offline" version of LightSPEED
 * which is designed to run in a standalone environment on a user's own
 * computer, rather than in a server-client environment.  In particular, it
 * has the classes used to move project data between databases.  This
 * is designed to let users download their project from a web-based system
 * and load it into a local database.
 * <p>
 * Note that, at this time, the offline version is only in alpha test, and
 * it is still accessed via a browser interface.  This means the user has to
 * install a local copy of an application and web server such as Tomcat.
