/**
 * Contains all the "utility" classes that are generic across many
 * parts of the application, but are specific to the Lightspeed
 * application. (Utilities that could be common to many applications
 * are in {@link com.lightspeedeps.util.common}.
 * <p>
 * Most of the classes consist of a set of utility methods related
 * to some underlying class or larger functionality.  For example,
 * {@link com.lightspeedeps.util.app.EventUtils} has methods for creating
 * and storing Event objects in our database.
